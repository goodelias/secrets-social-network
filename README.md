# secrets-social-network
This is a social network, where everyone can create their own truly secure account and post their secret anonymously in order to donâ€™t keep them just in the head, but on the contrary, share them with other users of this amazing social network.
An authorization feature was implemented, so everyone can create their own account, e.g, via Google or Facebook. As for user passwords, they are also stored securely in the database, because the password-hashing function bcrypt was used.
